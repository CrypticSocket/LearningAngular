# NewApp - First App using Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 10.1.3.

## The Idea

The idea of the first app is to make a customer's orders list which I can filter out by typing in a search bar.
To learn all that I can in Angular, I will try to also use Routing and services.
